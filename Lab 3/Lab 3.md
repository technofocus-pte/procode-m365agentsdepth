# Deploy a MCP Server and use it in the Copilot Studio 

## Objective

In this lab your will build a Declarative Agent with TypeSpec definition using Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit. You will create an agent called RepairServiceAgent, which interacts with repairs data via an existing API service to help users manage car repair records.

**Declarative agents** 

Declarative agents are a type of agents for Microsoft 365. You can build one by extending Microsoft 365 Copilot. You define custom knowledge and custom actions to create agents tailored to a specific scenario.
Declarative agents use the same infrastructure, orchestrator, foundation model, and security controls as Microsoft 365 Copilot, which ensures a consistent and familiar user experience.
